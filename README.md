# cp-services

Copies user-created CheckPoint service groups from a source management to a destination management.
Member services need to exists before running this script.

It's a work in progress. I'll be adding so it also copies member services before creating groups.

## Features
* copies user-created service groups from one SMS to another SMS
* asks for IP/hostname of SMS'
* asks for username/password (hides password if able to)

## Todo
* create user-created services in affected groups
* incorporate other object-types
